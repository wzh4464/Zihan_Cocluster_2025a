  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Biclustering of transcriptomic data groups genes and samples simultaneously. It is emerging as a standard tool for extracting knowledge from gene expression measurements. We propose a novel generative approach for biclustering called `FABIA: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition'. FABIA is based on a multiplicative model, which accounts for linear dependencies between gene expression and conditions, and also captures heavy-tailed distributions as observed in real-world transcriptomic data. The generative framework allows to utilize well-founded model selection methods and to apply Bayesian techniques.             Results: On 100 simulated datasets with known true, artificially implanted biclusters, FABIA clearly outperformed all 11 competitors. On these datasets, FABIA was able to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters by ranking biclusters according to their information content. FABIA was tested on three microarray datasets with known subclusters, where it was two times the best and once the second best method among the compared biclustering approaches.

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Over the past decade, several biclustering approaches have been published in the field of gene expression data analysis. Despite of huge diversity regarding the mathematical concepts of the different biclustering methods, many of them can be related to the singular value decomposition (SVD). Recently, a sparse SVD approach (SSVD) has been proposed to reveal biclusters in gene expression data. In this article, we propose to incorporate stability selection to improve this method. Stability selection is a subsampling-based variable selection that allows to control Type I error rates. The here proposed S4VD algorithm incorporates this subsampling approach to find stable biclusters, and to estimate the selection probabilities of genes and samples to belong to the biclusters.             Results: So far, the S4VD method is the first biclustering approach that takes the cluster stability regarding perturbations of the data into account. Application of the S4VD algorithm to a lung cancer microarray dataset revealed biclusters that correspond to coregulated genes associated with cancer subtypes. Marker genes for different lung cancer subtypes showed high selection probabilities to belong to the corresponding biclusters. Moreover, the genes associated with the biclusters belong to significantly enriched cancer-related Gene Ontology categories. In a simulation study, the S4VD algorithm outperformed the SSVD algorithm and two other SVD-related biclustering methods in recovering artificial biclusters and in being robust to noisy data.

There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above.

Results               In this paper, a novel biclustering algorithm based on evolutionary computation, a sub-field of artificial intelligence, is introduced. The method called EBIC aims to detect order-preserving patterns in complex data. EBIC is capable of discovering multiple complex patterns with unprecedented accuracy in real gene expression datasets. It is also one of the very few biclustering methods designed for parallel environments with multiple graphics processing units. We demonstrate that EBIC greatly outperforms state-of-the-art biclustering methods, in terms of recovery and relevance, on both synthetic and genetic datasets.

Recently, the biclustering task has been formulated as a convex optimization problem. While this convex recasting of the problem has attractive properties, existing algorithms do not scale well. To address this problem and make convex biclustering a practical tool for analyzing larger data, we propose an implementation of fast convex biclustering called COBRAC to reduce the computing time by iteratively compressing problem size along with the solution path. We apply COBRAC to several gene expression datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Besides the standalone version for COBRAC, we also developed a related online web server for online calculation and visualization of the downloadable interactive results.

Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space.             Results: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.

However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

To exploit this opportunity, we have developed a system for automated cell lineage tracing during               C. elegans               embryogenesis, based on 3D, time-lapse imaging and automated image analysis. Using ubiquitously expressed histone--GFP fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a confocal microscope, the imaging protocol captures embryogenesis at high spatial (31 planes at 1 {$\mu$}m apart) and temporal (every minute) resolution without apparent effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms then automatically recognizes cells at each time point, tracks cell movements, divisions and deaths over time and assigns cell identities based on the canonical naming scheme. Starting from the four-cell stage (or earlier), our software, named               starrynite               , can trace the lineage up to the 350-cell stage in 25 min on a desktop computer. The few errors of automated lineaging can then be corrected in a few hours with a graphic interface that allows easy navigation of the images and the reported lineage tree. The system can be used to characterize lineage phenotypes of genes and/or extended to determine gene expression patterns in a living embryo at the single-cell level. We envision that this automation will make it practical to systematically decipher the developmental genes and pathways encoded in the genome of               C. elegans               .},

Dorsal intercalation in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo involves the mediolateral intercalation of two rows of dorsal epidermal cells to create a single row that straddles the dorsal midline, and thus is a simple model to study cell intercalation. Polarized protrusive activity during dorsal intercalation requires the C. elegans Rac and RhoG orthologs CED-10 and MIG-2, but how these GTPases are regulated during intercalation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) TIAM-1 in regulating actin-based protrusive dynamics during dorsal intercalation. We found that TIAM-1 can promote formation of the main medial lamellipodial protrusion extended by intercalating cells through its canonical GEF function, whereas its N-terminal domains function to negatively regulate the generation of ectopic filiform protrusions around the periphery of intercalating cells. We also show that the guidance receptor UNC-5 inhibits these ectopic filiform protrusions in dorsal epidermal cells and that this effect is in part mediated via TIAM-1. These results expand the network of proteins that regulate basolateral protrusive activity during directed rearrangement of epithelial cells in animal embryos.}

It was first applied to gene expression data in 2000, aiming to identify co-expressed genes under a subset of all the conditions/samples. During the past 17\,years, tens of biclustering algorithms and tools have been developed to enhance the ability to make sense out of large data sets generated in the wake of high-throughput omics technologies. These algorithms and tools have been applied to a wide variety of data types, including but not limited to, genomes, transcriptomes, exomes, epigenomes, phenomes and pharmacogenomes. However, there is still a considerable gap between biclustering methodology development and comprehensive data interpretation, mainly because of the lack of knowledge for the selection of appropriate biclustering tools and further supporting computational techniques in specific studies. Here, we first deliver a brief introduction to the existing biclustering algorithms and tools in public domain, and then systematically summarize the basic applications of biclustering for biological data and more advanced applications of biclustering for biomedical data.

During embryogenesis 671 cells are generated; in the hermaphrodite 113 of these (in the male 111) undergo programmed death and the remainder either differentiate terminally or become postembryonic blast cells. The embryonic lineage is highly invariant, as are the fates of the cells to which it gives rise. In spite of the fixed relationship between cell ancestry and cell fate, the correlation between them lacks much obvious pattern. Thus, although most neurons arise from the embryonic ectoderm, some are produced by the mesoderm and a few are sisters to muscles; again, lineal boundaries do not necessarily coincide with functional boundaries. Nevertheless, cell ablation experiments (as well as previous cell isolation experiments) demonstrate substantial cell autonomy in at least some sections of embryogenesis. We conclude that the cell lineage itself, complex as it is, plays an important role in determining cell fate. We discuss the origin of the repeat units (partial segments) in the body wall, the generation of the various orders of symmetry, the analysis of the lineage in terms of sublineages, and evolutionary implications.},

We show that higher-order tensors (i.e., multiway arrays) enable such a fundamental paradigm shift toward models that are essentially polynomial, the uniqueness of which, unlike the matrix methods, is guaranteed under very mild and natural conditions. Benefiting from the power of multilinear algebra as their mathematical backbone, data analysis techniques using tensor decompositions are shown to have great flexibility in the choice of constraints which match data properties and extract more general latent components in the data than matrix-based methods.},

  abstract = {Quantitative characterizations of cellular dynamics and features of individual cells from a large heterogenous population is essential to identify rare, disease-driving cells, which often exhibit aberrant cellular behaviors like abnormal division, aggressive migration or irregular phylogenetic cell lineages. A recent development in the combination of high-throughput screening microscopy with single cell profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to decipher the underlying mechanisms of disease-driving phenotypes observed under a microscope. However, accurately and instantly processing large amounts of image data like longitudinal time lapse movies remains a technical challenge when an immediate analysis output (in minutes) of quantitative characterizations is required after data acquisition. Here we present a Fast and Accurate real-time Cell Tracking (FACT) algorithm, which combines GPU-based, ground truth-assisted trainable Weka segmentation and real-time Gaussian mixture model-based cell linking. FACT also implements an automatic cell track correction function to improve the tracking accuracy. With FACT, we can segment {$\sim$}20,000 cells in 2 seconds ({$\sim$}4.5-27.5 times faster than state-of-the-art), and can export quantifiable features from the cell tracking results minutes after data acquisition (independent of the number of acquired image frames) with average 90-95\% tracking precision. Such performance is not feasible with state-of-the-art cell tracking algorithms. We applied FACT to real-time identify directionally migrating glioblastoma cells with 96\% precision and to identify rare, irregular cell lineages in a population of {$\sim$}10,000 cells from a 24hr-time lapse movie with an average 91\% F1 score, results from both were exported instantly, mere minutes after image acquisition.},

  abstract = {How do we find patterns in author-keyword associations, evolving over time? Or in data cubes (tensors), with product-branchcustomer sales information? And more generally, how to summarize high-order data cubes (tensors)? How to incrementally update these patterns over time? Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like streaming data, text, graphs, social networks, and many more settings. However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and keyword in the previous example).We propose to envision such higher-order data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity.We implement all our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements. Our empirical studies show that the proposed methods are fast and accurate and that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.},

Two simply produce twenty intestinal (E) or muscle (D) cells each, whereas the remainder produce a total of 518 cells which collectively contribute in a complex pattern to a variety of tissues1. A central problem in embryonic development is to understand how the developmental potential of blastomeres is restricted to permit the terminal expression of such complex differentiation patterns. Here we identify a gene, lit-1, that appears to play a central role in controlling the asymmetry of cell division during embryogenesis in C. elegans. Mutants in lit-1 suggest that its product controls up to six consecutive binary switches which cause one of the two equivalent cells produced at each cleavage to assume a posterior fate. Most blastomere identities in C. elegans may therefore stem from a process of stepwise binary diversification.},

Simple model organisms provide attractive platforms for devising and streamlining efficient drug discovery and drug target identification methodologies. The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a particularly convenient and versatile tool that can be exploited to achieve these goals. Although C. elegans is a relatively modern addition to the arsenal of model organisms, its biology has already been investigated to an exceptional level. This, coupled with effortless handling and a notable low cost of cultivation and maintenance, allows seamless implementation of high-throughput drug screening approaches as well as in-depth genetic and biochemical studies of the molecular pathways targeted by specific drugs. In this review, we introduce C. elegans as a model organism with significant advantages toward the identification of molecular drug targets. In addition, we discuss the value of the worm in the development of drug screening and drug evaluation protocols. The unique features of C. elegans, which greatly facilitate drug studies, hold promise for both deciphering disease pathogenesis and formulating educated and effective therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Morphogenetic epithelial movement occurs during embryogenesis and drives complex tissue formation. However, how epithelial cells coordinate their unidirectional movement while maintaining epithelial integrity is unclear. Here we propose a novel mechanism for collective epithelial cell movement based on Drosophila genitalia rotation, in which epithelial tissue rotates clockwise around the genitalia. We found that this cell movement occurs autonomously and requires myosin II. The moving cells exhibit repeated left--right-biased junction remodelling, while maintaining adhesion with their neighbours, in association with a polarized myosin II distribution. Reducing myosinID, known to cause counter-clockwise epithelial-tissue movement, reverses the myosin II distribution. Numerical simulations revealed that a left--right asymmetry in cell intercalation is sufficient to induce unidirectional cellular movement. The cellular movement direction is also associated with planar cell-shape chirality. These findings support a model in which left--right asymmetric cell intercalation within an epithelial sheet drives collective cellular movement in the same direction.},

These include being easy to culture; undergoing rapid reproduction with a short generation time enabling large-scale production of animals; small size, which allows assays of more than a hundred animals in a single well of a 96-well plate; transparency, which enables the use of fluorescent markers to study biological processes in vivo; and cellular complexity --- C. elegans is a multicellular organism that has many different organs and tissues.Although in many cases a direct translation of human pathology into C. elegans phenotypes is impossible, C. elegans assays emulate certain aspects of human pathology. These help to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and to deliver new approaches for therapeutic strategies, rather than recapitulating human disease pathology in every detail.The benefit of C. elegans over mice or rats is its amenability to whole-animal high-throughput technologies. C. elegans investigations have already fostered a better understanding of the underlying mechanism for several diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and depression.WormBase, a database of C. elegans genetic and genomic information curated by a consortium of researchers, is an excellent resource for those wishing to use C. elegans as a model organism.The availability of C. elegans RNA interference (RNAi) libraries has made it possible to carry out high-throughput genome-wide RNAi, which has shown success in identifying drug targets for diabetes and obesity.C. elegans genetics can also be used to dissect the in vivo action of a drug, even if it modulates several targets. For example, antidepressant drug action can be studied in a functional serotonergic synapse within the context of a whole organism.Although there are intrinsic limitations associated with C. elegans, such as the absence of some human molecular pathways in the worm, and the inability to model the complete pathophysiology of the disease, if the purpose and potential restrictions of the model are defined, the value of C. elegans in high-throughput, whole-organism screens becomes apparent.},

Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

CP decomposition is one of the most useful tensor decomposition models for capturing the essential information in massive multi-way chemical data and for efficiently performing computations with such tensors. However, efficiently and accurately computing the tensor decomposition itself is a nontrivial problem that sometimes limits the advantage of tensor decomposition methods. In this work we propose and test three new decomposition algorithms, that are defined from extrapolation ideas applied to the alternating least square (ALS) algorithm for CP tensor decomposition. The performance of the proposed algorithms are validated on both a variety of simulated datasets and real experimental datasets including fluorescence spectroscopy data, hyperspectral data and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The results show that the proposed algorithms significantly accelerate the standard CP-ALS decomposition while maintaining favorable accuracy. One of the proposed methods, denoted direct inversion of the iterative subspace-like extrapolated ALS(CP-AD), is inspired from widely used extrapolation procedures used in the context of solving non-linear equations in quantum chemistry, and shows a particular attractive combination of a much reduced number of iterations needed for convergence, and modest computational cost. For example, CP-AD provided resulting tensors of similar accuracy but significantly lower computational cost than the standard CP-ALS algorithm and the widely used line-search based CP-ALS extrapolation procedure. The proposed methodology may thereby boost the application of tensor decomposition modeling in both experimental and computational chemistry.}

This paper has shown that leveraging multi-view information is able to provide a rich and comprehensive description. One of the core problems is how to sufficiently represent multi-view data in the analysis. In this paper, we introduce a tensor-based representation learning method for multi-view clustering (tRLMvC) that can unify heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-view feature spaces to a low-dimensional shared latent feature space and improve multi-view clustering performance. To sufficiently capture plenty multi-view information, the tRLMvC represents multi-view data as a third-order tensor, expresses each tensorial data point as a sparse t-linear combination of all data points with t-product, and constructs a self-expressive tensor through reconstruction coefficients. The low-dimensional multi-view data representation in the shared latent feature space can be obtained via Tucker decomposition on the self-expressive tensor. These two parts are iteratively performed so that the interaction between self-expressive tensor learning and its factorization can be enhanced and the new representation can be effectively generated for clustering purpose. We conduct extensive experiments on eight multi-view data sets and compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results have shown that tRLMvC outperforms the baselines in terms of various evaluation metrics.},
