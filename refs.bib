  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Biclustering algorithms are commonly used for gene expression data analysis. However, accurate identification of meaningful structures is very challenging and state-of-the-art methods are incapable of discovering with high accuracy different patterns of high biological relevance.                                         Results               In this paper, a novel biclustering algorithm based on evolutionary computation, a sub-field of artificial intelligence, is introduced. The method called EBIC aims to detect order-preserving patterns in complex data. EBIC is capable of discovering multiple complex patterns with unprecedented accuracy in real gene expression datasets. It is also one of the very few biclustering methods designed for parallel environments with multiple graphics processing units. We demonstrate that EBIC greatly outperforms state-of-the-art biclustering methods, in terms of recovery and relevance, on both synthetic and genetic datasets. EBIC also yields results over 12 times faster than the most accurate reference algorithms.

Recently, the biclustering task has been formulated as a convex optimization problem. While this convex recasting of the problem has attractive properties, existing algorithms do not scale well. To address this problem and make convex biclustering a practical tool for analyzing larger data, we propose an implementation of fast convex biclustering called COBRAC to reduce the computing time by iteratively compressing problem size along with the solution path. We apply COBRAC to several gene expression datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Besides the standalone version for COBRAC, we also developed a related online web server for online calculation and visualization of the downloadable interactive results.

For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space.             Results: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.

  abstract = {A large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

To exploit this opportunity, we have developed a system for automated cell lineage tracing during               C. elegans               embryogenesis, based on 3D, time-lapse imaging and automated image analysis. Using ubiquitously expressed histone--GFP fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a confocal microscope, the imaging protocol captures embryogenesis at high spatial (31 planes at 1 {$\mu$}m apart) and temporal (every minute) resolution without apparent effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms then automatically recognizes cells at each time point, tracks cell movements, divisions and deaths over time and assigns cell identities based on the canonical naming scheme. Starting from the four-cell stage (or earlier), our software, named               starrynite               , can trace the lineage up to the 350-cell stage in 25 min on a desktop computer. The few errors of automated lineaging can then be corrected in a few hours with a graphic interface that allows easy navigation of the images and the reported lineage tree. The system can be used to characterize lineage phenotypes of genes and/or extended to determine gene expression patterns in a living embryo at the single-cell level. We envision that this automation will make it practical to systematically decipher the developmental genes and pathways encoded in the genome of               C. elegans               .},

  abstract = {Mediolateral cell intercalation is a morphogenetic strategy used throughout animal development to reshape tissues. Dorsal intercalation in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo involves the mediolateral intercalation of two rows of dorsal epidermal cells to create a single row that straddles the dorsal midline, and thus is a simple model to study cell intercalation. Polarized protrusive activity during dorsal intercalation requires the C. elegans Rac and RhoG orthologs CED-10 and MIG-2, but how these GTPases are regulated during intercalation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) TIAM-1 in regulating actin-based protrusive dynamics during dorsal intercalation. We found that TIAM-1 can promote formation of the main medial lamellipodial protrusion extended by intercalating cells through its canonical GEF function, whereas its N-terminal domains function to negatively regulate the generation of ectopic filiform protrusions around the periphery of intercalating cells. We also show that the guidance receptor UNC-5 inhibits these ectopic filiform protrusions in dorsal epidermal cells and that this effect is in part mediated via TIAM-1. These results expand the network of proteins that regulate basolateral protrusive activity during directed rearrangement of epithelial cells in animal embryos.}

It was first applied to gene expression data in 2000, aiming to identify co-expressed genes under a subset of all the conditions/samples. During the past 17\,years, tens of biclustering algorithms and tools have been developed to enhance the ability to make sense out of large data sets generated in the wake of high-throughput omics technologies. These algorithms and tools have been applied to a wide variety of data types, including but not limited to, genomes, transcriptomes, exomes, epigenomes, phenomes and pharmacogenomes. However, there is still a considerable gap between biclustering methodology development and comprehensive data interpretation, mainly because of the lack of knowledge for the selection of appropriate biclustering tools and further supporting computational techniques in specific studies. Here, we first deliver a brief introduction to the existing biclustering algorithms and tools in public domain, and then systematically summarize the basic applications of biclustering for biological data and more advanced applications of biclustering for biomedical data. This review will assist researchers to effectively analyze their big data and generate valuable biological knowledge and novel insights with higher efficiency.},

As such, it focuses on fundamentals and motivation (using various application examples), aiming to strike an appropriate balance of breadth and depth that will enable someone having taken first graduate courses in matrix algebra and probability to get started doing research and/or developing tensor algorithms and software. Some background in applied optimization is useful but not strictly required. The material covered includes tensor rank and rank decomposition; basic tensor factorization models and their relationships and properties (including fairly good coverage of identifiability); broad coverage of algorithms ranging from alternating optimization to stochastic gradient; statistical performance analysis; and applications ranging from source separation to collaborative filtering, mixture and topic modeling, classification, and multilinear subspace learning.},

During embryogenesis 671 cells are generated; in the hermaphrodite 113 of these (in the male 111) undergo programmed death and the remainder either differentiate terminally or become postembryonic blast cells. The embryonic lineage is highly invariant, as are the fates of the cells to which it gives rise. In spite of the fixed relationship between cell ancestry and cell fate, the correlation between them lacks much obvious pattern. Thus, although most neurons arise from the embryonic ectoderm, some are produced by the mesoderm and a few are sisters to muscles; again, lineal boundaries do not necessarily coincide with functional boundaries. Nevertheless, cell ablation experiments (as well as previous cell isolation experiments) demonstrate substantial cell autonomy in at least some sections of embryogenesis. We conclude that the cell lineage itself, complex as it is, plays an important role in determining cell fate. We discuss the origin of the repeat units (partial segments) in the body wall, the generation of the various orders of symmetry, the analysis of the lineage in terms of sublineages, and evolutionary implications.},

Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like streaming data, text, graphs, social networks, and many more settings. However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and keyword in the previous example).We propose to envision such higher-order data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity.We implement all our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements. Our empirical studies show that the proposed methods are fast and accurate and that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.},

A central problem in embryonic development is to understand how the developmental potential of blastomeres is restricted to permit the terminal expression of such complex differentiation patterns. Here we identify a gene, lit-1, that appears to play a central role in controlling the asymmetry of cell division during embryogenesis in C. elegans. Mutants in lit-1 suggest that its product controls up to six consecutive binary switches which cause one of the two equivalent cells produced at each cleavage to assume a posterior fate. Most blastomere identities in C. elegans may therefore stem from a process of stepwise binary diversification.},

  abstract = {Morphogenetic epithelial movement occurs during embryogenesis and drives complex tissue formation. However, how epithelial cells coordinate their unidirectional movement while maintaining epithelial integrity is unclear. Here we propose a novel mechanism for collective epithelial cell movement based on Drosophila genitalia rotation, in which epithelial tissue rotates clockwise around the genitalia. We found that this cell movement occurs autonomously and requires myosin II. The moving cells exhibit repeated left--right-biased junction remodelling, while maintaining adhesion with their neighbours, in association with a polarized myosin II distribution. Reducing myosinID, known to cause counter-clockwise epithelial-tissue movement, reverses the myosin II distribution. Numerical simulations revealed that a left--right asymmetry in cell intercalation is sufficient to induce unidirectional cellular movement. The cellular movement direction is also associated with planar cell-shape chirality. These findings support a model in which left--right asymmetric cell intercalation within an epithelial sheet drives collective cellular movement in the same direction.},

  abstract = {C. elegans is a model organism that has the potential to bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo approaches by virtue of being amenable to high-throughput technologies while providing physiologically relevant data derived from a whole-animal setting.Several features of C. elegans make it a powerful tool for the pharmaceutical industry. These include being easy to culture; undergoing rapid reproduction with a short generation time enabling large-scale production of animals; small size, which allows assays of more than a hundred animals in a single well of a 96-well plate; transparency, which enables the use of fluorescent markers to study biological processes in vivo; and cellular complexity --- C. elegans is a multicellular organism that has many different organs and tissues.Although in many cases a direct translation of human pathology into C. elegans phenotypes is impossible, C. elegans assays emulate certain aspects of human pathology. These help to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and to deliver new approaches for therapeutic strategies, rather than recapitulating human disease pathology in every detail.The benefit of C. elegans over mice or rats is its amenability to whole-animal high-throughput technologies. C. elegans investigations have already fostered a better understanding of the underlying mechanism for several diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and depression.WormBase, a database of C. elegans genetic and genomic information curated by a consortium of researchers, is an excellent resource for those wishing to use C. elegans as a model organism.The availability of C. elegans RNA interference (RNAi) libraries has made it possible to carry out high-throughput genome-wide RNAi, which has shown success in identifying drug targets for diabetes and obesity.C. elegans genetics can also be used to dissect the in vivo action of a drug, even if it modulates several targets. For example, antidepressant drug action can be studied in a functional serotonergic synapse within the context of a whole organism.Although there are intrinsic limitations associated with C. elegans, such as the absence of some human molecular pathways in the worm, and the inability to model the complete pathophysiology of the disease, if the purpose and potential restrictions of the model are defined, the value of C. elegans in high-throughput, whole-organism screens becomes apparent.},

Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

  abstract = {Tensor decomposition is widely used for multi-way data analysis and computations in chemical science. CP decomposition is one of the most useful tensor decomposition models for capturing the essential information in massive multi-way chemical data and for efficiently performing computations with such tensors. However, efficiently and accurately computing the tensor decomposition itself is a nontrivial problem that sometimes limits the advantage of tensor decomposition methods. In this work we propose and test three new decomposition algorithms, that are defined from extrapolation ideas applied to the alternating least square (ALS) algorithm for CP tensor decomposition. The performance of the proposed algorithms are validated on both a variety of simulated datasets and real experimental datasets including fluorescence spectroscopy data, hyperspectral data and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The results show that the proposed algorithms significantly accelerate the standard CP-ALS decomposition while maintaining favorable accuracy. One of the proposed methods, denoted direct inversion of the iterative subspace-like extrapolated ALS(CP-AD), is inspired from widely used extrapolation procedures used in the context of solving non-linear equations in quantum chemistry, and shows a particular attractive combination of a much reduced number of iterations needed for convergence, and modest computational cost. For example, CP-AD provided resulting tensors of similar accuracy but significantly lower computational cost than the standard CP-ALS algorithm and the widely used line-search based CP-ALS extrapolation procedure. The proposed methodology may thereby boost the application of tensor decomposition modeling in both experimental and computational chemistry.}

  abstract = {With the development of data collection techniques, multi-view clustering becomes an emerging research direction to improve the clustering performance. This paper has shown that leveraging multi-view information is able to provide a rich and comprehensive description. One of the core problems is how to sufficiently represent multi-view data in the analysis. In this paper, we introduce a tensor-based representation learning method for multi-view clustering (tRLMvC) that can unify heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-view feature spaces to a low-dimensional shared latent feature space and improve multi-view clustering performance. To sufficiently capture plenty multi-view information, the tRLMvC represents multi-view data as a third-order tensor, expresses each tensorial data point as a sparse t-linear combination of all data points with t-product, and constructs a self-expressive tensor through reconstruction coefficients. The low-dimensional multi-view data representation in the shared latent feature space can be obtained via Tucker decomposition on the self-expressive tensor. These two parts are iteratively performed so that the interaction between self-expressive tensor learning and its factorization can be enhanced and the new representation can be effectively generated for clustering purpose. We conduct extensive experiments on eight multi-view data sets and compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results have shown that tRLMvC outperforms the baselines in terms of various evaluation metrics.},

To exploit this opportunity, we have developed a system for automated cell lineage tracing during               C. elegans               embryogenesis, based on 3D, time-lapse imaging and automated image analysis. Using ubiquitously expressed histone--GFP fusion protein to label cells/nuclei and a confocal microscope, the imaging protocol captures embryogenesis at high spatial (31 planes at 1 {$\mu$}m apart) and temporal (every minute) resolution without apparent effects on development. A set of image analysis algorithms then automatically recognizes cells at each time point, tracks cell movements, divisions and deaths over time and assigns cell identities based on the canonical naming scheme. Starting from the four-cell stage (or earlier), our software, named               starrynite               , can trace the lineage up to the 350-cell stage in 25 min on a desktop computer. The few errors of automated lineaging can then be corrected in a few hours with a graphic interface that allows easy navigation of the images and the reported lineage tree. The system can be used to characterize lineage phenotypes of genes and/or extended to determine gene expression patterns in a living embryo at the single-cell level. We envision that this automation will make it practical to systematically decipher the developmental genes and pathways encoded in the genome of               C. elegans               .},

  abstract = {Quantifying the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial for understanding brain waste clearance and nutrient delivery, as well as edema in pathological conditions such as stroke. However, existing in vivo techniques are limited to sparse velocity measurements in pial perivascular spaces (PVSs) or low-resolution measurements from brain-wide imaging. Additionally, volume flow rate, pressure, and shear stress variation in PVSs are essentially impossible to measure in vivo. Here, we show that artificial intelligence velocimetry (AIV) can integrate sparse velocity measurements with physics-informed neural networks to quantify CSF flow in PVSs. With AIV, we infer three-dimensional (3D), high-resolution velocity, pressure, and shear stress. Validation comes from training with 70\% of PTV measurements and demonstrating close agreement with the remaining 30\%. A sensitivity analysis on the AIV inputs shows that the uncertainty in AIV inferred quantities due to uncertainties in the PVS boundary locations inherent to in vivo imaging is less than 30\%, and the uncertainty from the neural net initialization is less than 1\%. In PVSs of               N               = 4 wild-type mice we find mean flow speed 16.33 {\textpm} 11.09 {\textmu}m/s, volume flow rate 2.22 {\textpm} 1.983 {\texttimes} 10               3               {\textmu}m               3               /s, axial pressure gradient ( - 2.75 {\textpm} 2.01){\texttimes}10               -4               Pa/{\textmu}m (-2.07 {\textpm} 1.51 mmHg/m), and wall shear stress (3.00 {\textpm} 1.45){\texttimes}10               -3               Pa (all mean {\textpm} SE).

Hence, these cells are central to multicellularity, and participate in diverse biological processes such as organismal development, growth or immune response and their misfunction ultimately impacts disease. During the development of an organism, the first task epidermal cells must complete is the formation of a continuous sheet, which initiates its own morphogenic process. In this review, we will focus on the C. elegans embryonic epithelial morphogenesis. We will describe how its formation, maturation, and spatial arrangements set the final shape of the nematode C. elegans. Special importance will be given to the tissue-tissue interactions, regulatory tissue-tissue feedback mechanisms and the players orchestrating the process.},

  abstract = {With the development of data collection techniques, multi-view clustering becomes an emerging research direction to improve the clustering performance. This paper has shown that leveraging multi-view information is able to provide a rich and comprehensive description. One of the core problems is how to sufficiently represent multi-view data in the analysis. In this paper, we introduce a tensor-based representation learning method for multi-view clustering (tRLMvC) that can unify heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-view feature spaces to a low-dimensional shared latent feature space and improve multi-view clustering performance. To sufficiently capture plenty multi-view information, the tRLMvC represents multi-view data as a third-order tensor, expresses each tensorial data point as a sparse t-linear combination of all data points with t-product, and constructs a self-expressive tensor through reconstruction coefficients. The low-dimensional multi-view data representation in the shared latent feature space can be obtained via Tucker decomposition on the self-expressive tensor. These two parts are iteratively performed so that the interaction between self-expressive tensor learning and its factorization can be enhanced and the new representation can be effectively generated for clustering purpose. We conduct extensive experiments on eight multi-view data sets and compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results have shown that tRLMvC outperforms the baselines in terms of various evaluation metrics.},

  abstract = {The morphogenesis of the C. elegans embryo is largely controlled by the development of the epidermis, also known as the hypodermis, a single epithelial layer that surrounds the animal. Morphogenesis of the epidermis involves cell-cell interactions with internal tissues, such as the developing nervous system and musculature. Genetic analysis of mutants with aberrant epidermal morphology has defined multiple steps in epidermal morphogenesis. In the wild type, epidermal cells are generated on the dorsal side of the embryo among the progeny of four early embryonic blastomeres. Specification of epidermal fate is regulated by a hierarchy of transcription factors. After specification, dorsal epidermal cells rearrange, a process known as dorsal intercalation. Most epidermal cells fuse to generate multinucleate syncytia. The dorsally located epidermal sheet undergoes epiboly to enclose the rest of the embryo in a process known as ventral enclosure; this movement requires both an intact epidermal layer and substrate neuroblasts. At least three distinct types of cellular behavior underlie the enclosure of different regions of the epidermis. Following enclosure, the epidermis elongates, a process driven by coordinated cell shape changes. Epidermal actin microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments all play roles in elongation, as do body wall muscles. The final shape of the epidermis is maintained by the collagenous exoskeleton, secreted by the apical surface of the epidermis.},

  abstract = {Quantitative characterizations of cellular dynamics and features of individual cells from a large heterogenous population is essential to identify rare, disease-driving cells, which often exhibit aberrant cellular behaviors like abnormal division, aggressive migration or irregular phylogenetic cell lineages. A recent development in the combination of high-throughput screening microscopy with single cell profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to decipher the underlying mechanisms of disease-driving phenotypes observed under a microscope. However, accurately and instantly processing large amounts of image data like longitudinal time lapse movies remains a technical challenge when an immediate analysis output (in minutes) of quantitative characterizations is required after data acquisition. Here we present a Fast and Accurate real-time Cell Tracking (FACT) algorithm, which combines GPU-based, ground truth-assisted trainable Weka segmentation and real-time Gaussian mixture model-based cell linking. FACT also implements an automatic cell track correction function to improve the tracking accuracy. With FACT, we can segment {$\sim$}20,000 cells in 2 seconds ({$\sim$}4.5-27.5 times faster than state-of-the-art), and can export quantifiable features from the cell tracking results minutes after data acquisition (independent of the number of acquired image frames) with average 90-95\% tracking precision. Such performance is not feasible with state-of-the-art cell tracking algorithms. We applied FACT to real-time identify directionally migrating glioblastoma cells with 96\% precision and to identify rare, irregular cell lineages in a population of {$\sim$}10,000 cells from a 24hr-time lapse movie with an average 91\% F1 score, results from both were exported instantly, mere minutes after image acquisition.},

  abstract = {Time-lapse imaging is a powerful approach to gain insight into the dynamic responses of cells, but the quantitative analysis of morphological changes over time remains challenging. Here, we exploit the concept of ``trajectory embedding'' to analyze cellular behavior using morphological feature trajectory histories---that is, multiple time points simultaneously, rather than the more common practice of examining morphological feature time courses in single timepoint (snapshot) morphological features. We apply this approach to analyze live-cell images of MCF10A mammary epithelial cells after treatment with a panel of microenvironmental perturbagens that strongly modulate cell motility, morphology, and cell cycle behavior. Our morphodynamical trajectory embedding analysis constructs a shared cell state landscape revealing ligand-specific regulation of cell state transitions and enables quantitative and descriptive models of single-cell trajectories. Additionally, we show that incorporation of trajectories into single-cell morphological analysis enables (i) systematic characterization of cell state trajectories, (ii) better separation of phenotypes, and (iii) more descriptive models of ligand-induced differences as compared to snapshot-based analysis. This morphodynamical trajectory embedding is broadly applicable to the quantitative analysis of cell responses via live-cell imaging across many biological and biomedical applications.},

  abstract = {We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines (Petitjean et al., 2011). Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense.

Furthermore, MESA integrates spatial and single-cell multiomics data to facilitate an in-depth, molecular understanding of cellular neighborhoods and their spatial interactions within tissue microenvironments. Applying MESA to diverse datasets demonstrates additional insights it brings over prior methods, including newly identified spatial structures and key cell populations linked to disease states.

For example, the irregular shapes of cancerous cells and elongated shapes of neuron cells often reflect specific functions, such as cell motility and cell communication.

In this study, 12 geometric shape descriptors for a three-dimensional (3D) object were collected from the previous literature and tested with a public dataset of {\textasciitilde}400,000 independent 3D cell regions segmented based on fluorescent labeling of the cell membranes in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. It is revealed that those shape descriptors can faithfully characterize cellular physiological states, including (1) cell division (cytokinesis), along with an abrupt increase in the elongation ratio; (2) a negative correlation of cell migration speed with cell sphericity; (3) cell lineage specification with symmetrically patterned cell shape changes; and (4) cell fate specification with differential gene expression and differential cell shapes. The descriptors established may be used to identify and predict the diverse physiological states in numerous cells, which could be used for not only studying developmental morphogenesis but also diagnosing human disease (e.g., the rapid detection of abnormal cells).},

It is emerging as a standard tool for extracting knowledge from gene expression measurements. We propose a novel generative approach for biclustering called `FABIA: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition'. FABIA is based on a multiplicative model, which accounts for linear dependencies between gene expression and conditions, and also captures heavy-tailed distributions as observed in real-world transcriptomic data. The generative framework allows to utilize well-founded model selection methods and to apply Bayesian techniques.             Results: On 100 simulated datasets with known true, artificially implanted biclusters, FABIA clearly outperformed all 11 competitors. On these datasets, FABIA was able to separate spurious biclusters from true biclusters by ranking biclusters according to their information content. FABIA was tested on three microarray datasets with known subclusters, where it was two times the best and once the second best method among the compared biclustering approaches.

Mutations in eight squashed vulva (sqv) genes in Caenorhabditis elegans cause defects in cytokinesis during embryogenesis and in vulval morphogenesis during postembryonic development5,6. Seven of the eight sqv genes have been shown to control the biosynthesis of the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin and heparan sulphate6,7,8,9,10,11. Here we present the molecular identification and characterization of the eighth gene, sqv-5. This gene encodes a bifunctional glycosyltransferase that is probably localized to the Golgi apparatus and is responsible for the biosynthesis of chondroitin but not heparan sulphate. Our findings show that chondroitin is crucial for both cytokinesis and morphogenesis during C. elegans development.},

Two simply produce twenty intestinal (E) or muscle (D) cells each, whereas the remainder produce a total of 518 cells which collectively contribute in a complex pattern to a variety of tissues1. A central problem in embryonic development is to understand how the developmental potential of blastomeres is restricted to permit the terminal expression of such complex differentiation patterns. Here we identify a gene, lit-1, that appears to play a central role in controlling the asymmetry of cell division during embryogenesis in C. elegans. Mutants in lit-1 suggest that its product controls up to six consecutive binary switches which cause one of the two equivalent cells produced at each cleavage to assume a posterior fate. Most blastomere identities in C. elegans may therefore stem from a process of stepwise binary diversification.},

These include being easy to culture; undergoing rapid reproduction with a short generation time enabling large-scale production of animals; small size, which allows assays of more than a hundred animals in a single well of a 96-well plate; transparency, which enables the use of fluorescent markers to study biological processes in vivo; and cellular complexity --- C. elegans is a multicellular organism that has many different organs and tissues.Although in many cases a direct translation of human pathology into C. elegans phenotypes is impossible, C. elegans assays emulate certain aspects of human pathology. These help to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and to deliver new approaches for therapeutic strategies, rather than recapitulating human disease pathology in every detail.The benefit of C. elegans over mice or rats is its amenability to whole-animal high-throughput technologies. C. elegans investigations have already fostered a better understanding of the underlying mechanism for several diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and depression.WormBase, a database of C. elegans genetic and genomic information curated by a consortium of researchers, is an excellent resource for those wishing to use C. elegans as a model organism.The availability of C. elegans RNA interference (RNAi) libraries has made it possible to carry out high-throughput genome-wide RNAi, which has shown success in identifying drug targets for diabetes and obesity.C. elegans genetics can also be used to dissect the in vivo action of a drug, even if it modulates several targets. For example, antidepressant drug action can be studied in a functional serotonergic synapse within the context of a whole organism.Although there are intrinsic limitations associated with C. elegans, such as the absence of some human molecular pathways in the worm, and the inability to model the complete pathophysiology of the disease, if the purpose and potential restrictions of the model are defined, the value of C. elegans in high-throughput, whole-organism screens becomes apparent.},

For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space.             Results: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.

Two particular tensor decompositions can be considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decomposition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal component analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative variants of all of the above.

Here we present the new and simple mathematical parameter called signed morphomigrational angle (sMM angle) that links cell geometry with translocation of cell centroid, considering them as one morphomigrational behaviour. The sMM angle combined with pre-existing quantitative parameters enabled us to build a new tool called morphomigrational description, used to assign the numerical values to several cellular behaviours. Thus, the cellular activities that until now were characterized using verbal description or by complex mathematical models, are described here by a set of numbers. Our tool can be further used in automatic analysis of cell populations as well as in studies focused on cellular response to environmental directional signals.},

We used a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical approaches to identify the structural dynamics of prestin that mediate eM. MD simulations showed that prestin samples a vast conformational landscape with expanded (ES) and compact (CS) states beyond previously reported prestin structures. Transition from CS to ES is dominated by the translational-rotational movement of prestin's transport domain, akin to elevator-type substrate translocation by related solute carriers. Reversible transition between CS and ES states was supported experimentally by cysteine accessibility scanning, cysteine cross-linking between transport and scaffold domains, and voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF). Our data demonstrate that prestin's piezoelectric dynamics recapitulate essential steps of a structurally conserved ion transport cycle.},

  abstract = {Cell rearrangements are crucial during development. In this study, we useC. elegans gastrulation as a simple model to investigate the mechanisms of cell positioning. During C. elegans gastrulation, two endodermal precursor cells move from the ventral surface to the center of the embryo, leaving a gap between these ingressing cells and the eggshell. Six neighboring cells converge under the endodermal precursors, filling this gap. Using an in vitro system, we observed that these movements occurred consistently in the absence of the eggshell and the vitelline envelope. We found that movement of the neighbors towards each other is not dependent on chemotactic signaling between these cells. We further found that C. elegans gastrulation requires intact microfilaments, but not microtubules. The primary mechanism of microfilament-based motility does not appear to be through protrusive structures, such as lamellipodia or filopodia. Instead, our results suggest an alternative mechanism. We found that myosin activity is required for gastrulation, that the apical sides of the ingressing cells contract, and that the ingressing cells determine the direction of movement of their neighboring cells. Based on these results, we propose that ingression is driven by an actomyosin-based contraction of the apical side of the ingressing cells, which pulls neighboring cells underneath. We conclude that apical constriction can function to position blastomeres in early embryos, even before anchoring junctions form between cells.},

  abstract = {Background: Embryonic patterning mechanisms regulate the cytoskeletal machinery that drives morphogenesis, but there are few cases where links between patterning mechanisms and morphogenesis are well understood. We have used a combination of genetics, in vivo imaging, and cell manipulations to identify such links in C. elegans gastrulation. Gastrulation in C. elegans begins with the internalization of endodermal precursor cells in a process that depends on apical constriction of ingressing cells. Results: We show that ingression of the endodermal precursor cells is regulated by pathways, including a Wnt-Frizzled signaling pathway, that specify endodermal cell fate. We find that Wnt signaling has a role in gastrulation in addition to its earlier roles in regulating endodermal cell fate and cell-cycle timing. In the absence of Wnt signaling, endodermal precursor cells polarize and enrich myosin II apically but fail to contract their apical surfaces. We show that a regulatory myosin light chain normally becomes phosphorylated on the apical side of ingressing cells at a conserved site that can lead to myosin-filament formation and contraction of actomyosin networks and that this phosphorylation depends on Wnt signaling. Conclusions: We conclude that Wnt signaling regulates C. elegans gastrulation through regulatory myosin lightchain phosphorylation, which results in the contraction of the apical surface of ingressing cells. These findings forge new links between cell-fate specification and morphogenesis, and they represent a novel mechanism by which Wnt signaling can regulate morphogenesis. 背景：胚胎图式化机制调控驱动形态发生的细胞骨架机器，但在少数情况下，图式化机制和形态发生之间的联系是完全理解的。我们结合遗传学、体内成像和细胞操作，鉴定了在秀丽隐杆线虫（C. elegans）原肠胚形成中的这种联系。秀丽隐杆线虫的原肠胚形成始于内胚层前体细胞的内化，这一过程依赖于内陷细胞的顶端收缩。 结果：我们表明，内胚层前体细胞的内陷受包括Wnt-Frizzled信号通路在内的多条途径调控，这些途径决定内胚层细胞的命运。我们发现，除了在调控内胚层细胞命运和细胞周期时间上的早期作用外，Wnt信号在原肠胚形成中也发挥作用。在缺乏Wnt信号的情况下，内胚层前体细胞极化并在顶端富集肌球蛋白II，但未能收缩其顶端表面。我们展示了一种调节性肌球蛋白轻链通常在内陷细胞的顶端侧面被磷酸化，磷酸化发生在一个保守的位点，该位点可以导致肌球蛋白丝的形成和肌动蛋白-肌球蛋白网络的收缩，这一磷酸化依赖于Wnt信号。 结论：我们得出结论，Wnt信号通过调节性肌球蛋白轻链磷酸化调控秀丽隐杆线虫的原肠胚形成，从而导致内陷细胞顶端表面的收缩。这些发现建立了细胞命运决定和形态发生之间的新联系，并代表了一种Wnt信号调控形态发生的新机制。},

An in-depth analysis of information contained in phenotypic variability provides an important perspective to address this question. In this work, we present a quantitative and functional analysis of cell position variability during Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis. We find that cell position variability is highly deterministic and regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Positional variability is determined by cell lineage identity and is coupled to diverse developmental properties of cells, including embryonic localization, cell contact, and left-right symmetry. Temporal dynamics of cell position variability are highly concordant, and fate specification contributes to a systems-wide reduction of variability that could provide a buffering strategy. Positional variability is stringently regulated throughout embryogenesis and cell-cell junctions function to restrict variability. Our results provide insight into systems properties and spatiotemporal control of cellular variability during development.},

  abstract = {Cellular segmentation is a crucial step in creating cell shape maps and morphological graphs for living embryos from time-lapse 3D fluorescence images (laser confocal). One reliable method for segmenting cell shapes through deep learning networks is to incorporate voxel distance and topology priors to model shapes in topological structures. However, automated and CNN-based segmentation methods often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios and insufficient training data. Previous works on semantic segmentation have ignored directional distance and topological information. In this paper, we propose a 3D directional and topological transformer named DTTR (Directional distance mapping and Topological learning TRansformer), which uses topology priors to binarization, and demonstrates an effective directional latent space. We use attention calculation on directional distance maps and utilize topological loss and priors, along with an optimized Delaunay-clustering algorithm, to measure voxel predictions in higher dimensional topology space. DTTR outperforms other existing deep learning models and provides a reliable segmented cell instance dataset (22 new living C. elegans embryos) for establishing 4D cellular morphology map.},

Despite the advances in three-dimensional acquisition techniques, it is challenging to develop motion estimation algorithms in particle tracking due to large particle displacements, dense particle distributions and high computational cost. We present an end-to-end solution called graph optimal transport (GotFlow3D) to learn the three-dimensional fluid flow motion from consecutive particle images. The proposed model uses a graph neural network to extract geometric features and to further enrich the particle representations. The extracted deep features are subsequently used to correspond particles between consecutive frames, and the flow motion is then iteratively updated with a recurrent neural network approach. Experimental evaluations---including assessments on numerical experiments and validations on real-world experiments---demonstrate that GotFlow3D achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with recently developed scene flow learners and particle tracking algorithms. We believe that the high accuracy, robustness and generalization ability of our method can provide deeper insight into the complex dynamics of many physical and biological systems.},

  abstract = {A large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

  abstract = {Apical constriction is a change in cell shape that drives key morphogenetic events including gastrulation and neural tube formation. Apical force-producing actomyosin networks drive apical constriction by contracting while connected to cell-cell junctions. The mechanisms by which developmental patterning regulates these actomyosin networks and associated junctions with spatial precision are not fully understood. Here we identify a myosin light-chain kinase MRCK-1 as a key regulator of C.~elegans gastrulation that integrates spatial and developmental patterning information. We show that MRCK-1 is required for activation of contractile actomyosin dynamics and elevated cortical tension in the apical cell cortex of endoderm precursor cells. MRCK-1 is apically localized by active Cdc42 at the external, cell-cell contact-free surfaces of apically constricting cells, downstream of cell fate determination mechanisms. We establish that the junctional components {$\alpha$}-catenin, {$\beta$}-catenin, and cadherin become highly enriched at the apical junctions of apically constricting cells and that MRCK-1 and myosin activity are required in~vivo for this enrichment. Taken together, our results define mechanisms that position a myosin activator to a specific cell surface where it both locally increases cortical tension and locally enriches junctional components to facilitate apical constriction. These results reveal crucial links that can tie spatial information to local force generation to drive morphogenesis. 顶端收缩是一种细胞形态变化，驱动了包括原肠胚形成和神经管形成在内的关键形态发生事件。顶端产生力的肌动蛋白-肌球蛋白网络通过收缩并与细胞-细胞连接相连来驱动顶端收缩。发育模式如何精确地调控这些肌动蛋白-肌球蛋白网络及其相关连接的机制尚未完全理解。在此，我们确定了肌球蛋白轻链激酶MRCK-1作为秀丽隐杆线虫原肠胚形成的关键调节因子，它整合了空间和发育模式信息。我们展示了MRCK-1在顶端收缩细胞的顶端细胞皮质中激活收缩性肌动蛋白-肌球蛋白动力学和提高皮质张力是必要的。MRCK-1通过活化的Cdc42定位于顶端收缩细胞的外部无细胞接触的表面，处于细胞命运决定机制的下游。我们确定了顶端收缩细胞的顶端连接处{$\alpha$}-连环蛋白、{$\beta$}-连环蛋白和钙黏蛋白成分高度富集，并且MRCK-1和肌球蛋白的活性在体内对于这种富集是必需的。综合来看，我们的研究定义了将肌球蛋白激活器定位于特定细胞表面以局部增加皮质张力和局部富集连接成分以促进顶端收缩的机制。这些结果揭示了将空间信息与局部力生成联系起来以驱动形态发生的关键环节。},

Intricate patterns of cell shape can be analyzed and classified using advanced shape descriptors, including spherical harmonics (SPHARM). Though SPHARM have been used to analyze and classify migrating cells, such classification did not exploit SPHARM spectra in their dynamics. Here, we examine whether additional information from dynamic SPHARM improves classification of cell migration patterns. We combine the static and dynamic SPHARM approach with a support-vector-machine classifier and compare their classification accuracies. We demonstrate that the dynamic SPHARM analysis classifies cell migration patterns more accurately than the static one for both synthetic and experimental data. Furthermore, by comparing the computed accuracies with that of a naive classifier, we can identify the experimental conditions and model parameters that significantly affect cell shape. This capability should -- in the future -- help to pinpoint factors that play an essential role in cell migration.},

Understanding how precision in patterning is robustly achieved despite inherent developmental variability during mammalian embryogenesis remains a challenge. Here, based on cell dynamics quantification and simulation, we show how salt-and-pepper epiblast and primitive endoderm (PrE) cells pattern the inner cell mass of mouse blastocysts. Coupling cell fate and dynamics, PrE cells form apical polarity-dependent actin protrusions required for RAC1-dependent migration towards the surface of the fluid cavity, where PrE cells are trapped due to decreased tension. Concomitantly, PrE cells deposit an extracellular matrix gradient, presumably breaking the tissue-level symmetry and collectively guiding their own migration. Tissue size perturbations of mouse embryos and their comparison with monkey and human blastocysts further demonstrate that the fixed proportion of PrE/epiblast cells is optimal with respect to embryo size and tissue geometry and, despite variability, ensures patterning robustness during early mammalian development.},

The characterization of anomalous diffusion from the measurement of an individual trajectory is a challenging task, which traditionally relies on calculating the trajectory mean squared displacement. However, this approach breaks down for cases of practical interest, e.g., short or noisy trajectories, heterogeneous behaviour, or non-ergodic processes. Recently, several new approaches have been proposed, mostly building on the ongoing machine-learning revolution. To perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition, the Anomalous Diffusion challenge (AnDi). Participating teams applied their algorithms to a commonly-defined dataset including diverse conditions. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, machine-learning-based approaches achieved superior performance for all tasks. The discussion of the challenge results provides practical advice for users and a benchmark for developers.},

However, accurate identification of meaningful structures is very challenging and state-of-the-art methods are incapable of discovering with high accuracy different patterns of high biological relevance.                                         Results               In this paper, a novel biclustering algorithm based on evolutionary computation, a sub-field of artificial intelligence, is introduced. The method called EBIC aims to detect order-preserving patterns in complex data. EBIC is capable of discovering multiple complex patterns with unprecedented accuracy in real gene expression datasets. It is also one of the very few biclustering methods designed for parallel environments with multiple graphics processing units. We demonstrate that EBIC greatly outperforms state-of-the-art biclustering methods, in terms of recovery and relevance, on both synthetic and genetic datasets. EBIC also yields results over 12 times faster than the most accurate reference algorithms.

We used microfabricated 3-D biomimetic chips to validate predictions that shape-sensing occurs in a tension-independent manner through integrin {$\beta$}3 signaling pathway in human kidney podocytes and smooth muscle cells. Differential proteomics and functional ablation assays indicate that integrin {$\beta$}3 is critical in transduction of shape signals through ezrin--radixin--moesin (ERM) family. We used experimentally determined diffusion coefficients and experimentally validated simulations to show that shape sensing is an emergent cellular property enabled by multiple molecular characteristics of integrin {$\beta$}3.

In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

However, how epithelial cells coordinate their unidirectional movement while maintaining epithelial integrity is unclear. Here we propose a novel mechanism for collective epithelial cell movement based on Drosophila genitalia rotation, in which epithelial tissue rotates clockwise around the genitalia. We found that this cell movement occurs autonomously and requires myosin II. The moving cells exhibit repeated left--right-biased junction remodelling, while maintaining adhesion with their neighbours, in association with a polarized myosin II distribution. Reducing myosinID, known to cause counter-clockwise epithelial-tissue movement, reverses the myosin II distribution. Numerical simulations revealed that a left--right asymmetry in cell intercalation is sufficient to induce unidirectional cellular movement. The cellular movement direction is also associated with planar cell-shape chirality. These findings support a model in which left--right asymmetric cell intercalation within an epithelial sheet drives collective cellular movement in the same direction.},

Haloferax volcanii, a model haloarchaeon, forms rods and disks, depending on growth conditions. Here, we used a combination of iterative proteomics, genetics, and live-cell imaging to identify mutants that only form rods or disks. We compared the proteomes of the mutants with wild-type cells across growth phases, thereby distinguishing between protein abundance changes specific to cell shape and those related to growth phases. The results identified a diverse set of proteins, including predicted transporters, transducers, signaling components, and transcriptional regulators, as important for cell-shape determination. Through phenotypic characterization of deletion strains, we established that rod-determining factor A (RdfA) and disk-determining factor A (DdfA) are required for the formation of rods and disks, respectively. We also identified structural proteins, including an actin homolog that plays a role in disk-shape morphogenesis, which we named volactin. Using live-cell imaging, we determined volactin's cellular localization and showed its dynamic polymerization and depolymerization. Our results provide insights into archaeal cell-shape determination, with possible implications for understanding the evolution of cell morphology regulation across domains.},

  abstract = {Lymphatic capillaries continuously take up interstitial fluid and adapt to resulting changes in vessel calibre1--3. The mechanisms by which the permeable monolayer of loosely connected lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)4 maintains mechanical stability remain elusive. Here we identify dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of LEC shape, induced by isotropic stretch, as crucial for the integrity and function of dermal lymphatic capillaries. We found that the oak leaf-shaped LECs showed a spectrum of VE-cadherin-based junctional configurations at the lobular intercellular interface and a unique cytoskeletal organization, with microtubules at concave regions and F-actin at convex lobes. Multispectral and longitudinal intravital imaging of capillary LEC shape and actin revealed dynamic remodelling of cellular overlaps in vivo during homeostasis and in response to interstitial fluid volume increase. Akin to puzzle cells of the plant epidermis5,6, LEC shape was controlled by Rho GTPase CDC42-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing monolayer stability. Moreover, cyclic isotropic stretch increased cellular overlaps and junction curvature in primary LECs. Our findings indicate that capillary LEC shape results from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity while preserving permeable cell--cell contacts compatible with vessel expansion and fluid uptake. We propose a bellows-like fluid propulsion mechanism, in which fluid-induced lumen expansion and shrinkage of LEC overlaps are countered by actin-based lamellipodia-like overlap extension to aid vessel constriction.},

  abstract = {Combinatorial optimization problems are pervasive across science and industry. Modern deep learning tools are poised to solve these problems at unprecedented scales, but a unifying framework that incorporates insights from statistical physics is still outstanding. Here we demonstrate how graph neural networks can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Our approach is broadly applicable to canonical NP-hard problems in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, such as maximum cut, minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, as well as Ising spin glasses and higher-order generalizations thereof in the form of polynomial unconstrained binary optimization problems. We apply a relaxation strategy to the problem Hamiltonian to generate a differentiable loss function with which we train the graph neural network and apply a simple projection to integer variables once the unsupervised training process has completed. We showcase our approach with numerical results for the canonical maximum cut and maximum independent set problems. We find that the graph neural network optimizer performs on par or outperforms existing solvers, with the ability to scale beyond the state of the art to problems with millions of variables.},

The shape descriptors capture local statistics about the neuron to be segmented, such as diameter, elongation, and direction. On a study comparing several existing methods across various specimen, imaging techniques, and resolutions, auxiliary learning of LSDs consistently increases segmentation accuracy of affinity-based methods over a range of metrics. Furthermore, the addition of LSDs promotes affinity-based segmentation methods to be on par with the current state of the art for neuron segmentation (flood-filling networks), while being two orders of magnitudes more efficient---a critical requirement for the processing of future petabyte-sized datasets.},

Tensors have a rich history, stretching over almost a century, and touching upon numerous disciplines; but they have only recently become ubiquitous in signal and data analytics at the confluence of signal processing, statistics, data mining, and machine learning. This overview article aims to provide a good starting point for researchers and practitioners interested in learning about and working with tensors. As such, it focuses on fundamentals and motivation (using various application examples), aiming to strike an appropriate balance of breadth and depth that will enable someone having taken first graduate courses in matrix algebra and probability to get started doing research and/or developing tensor algorithms and software. Some background in applied optimization is useful but not strictly required. The material covered includes tensor rank and rank decomposition; basic tensor factorization models and their relationships and properties (including fairly good coverage of identifiability); broad coverage of algorithms ranging from alternating optimization to stochastic gradient; statistical performance analysis; and applications ranging from source separation to collaborative filtering, mixture and topic modeling, classification, and multilinear subspace learning.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Over the past decade, several biclustering approaches have been published in the field of gene expression data analysis. Despite of huge diversity regarding the mathematical concepts of the different biclustering methods, many of them can be related to the singular value decomposition (SVD). Recently, a sparse SVD approach (SSVD) has been proposed to reveal biclusters in gene expression data. In this article, we propose to incorporate stability selection to improve this method. Stability selection is a subsampling-based variable selection that allows to control Type I error rates. The here proposed S4VD algorithm incorporates this subsampling approach to find stable biclusters, and to estimate the selection probabilities of genes and samples to belong to the biclusters.             Results: So far, the S4VD method is the first biclustering approach that takes the cluster stability regarding perturbations of the data into account. Application of the S4VD algorithm to a lung cancer microarray dataset revealed biclusters that correspond to coregulated genes associated with cancer subtypes. Marker genes for different lung cancer subtypes showed high selection probabilities to belong to the corresponding biclusters. Moreover, the genes associated with the biclusters belong to significantly enriched cancer-related Gene Ontology categories. In a simulation study, the S4VD algorithm outperformed the SSVD algorithm and two other SVD-related biclustering methods in recovering artificial biclusters and in being robust to noisy data.             Availability: R-Code of the S4VD algorithm as well as a documentation can be found at http://s4vd.r-forge.r-project.org/.

  abstract = {Evidence from homogeneous liquid or flat-plate cultures indicates that biochemical cues are the primary modes of bacterial interaction with their microenvironment. However, these systems fail to capture the effect of physical confinement on bacteria in their natural habitats. Bacterial niches like the pores of soil, mucus, and infected tissues are disordered microenvironments with material properties defined by their internal pore sizes and shear moduli. Here, we use three-dimensional matrices that match the viscoelastic properties of gut mucus to test how altering the physical properties of their microenvironment influences the growth of bacteria under confinement. We find that low aspect~ratio (spherical) bacteria form compact, spherical colonies under confinement while high aspect~ratio (rod-shaped) bacteria push their progenies further outwards to create elongated colonies with a higher surface area, enabling increased access to nutrients. As a result, the population growth of high aspect~ratio bacteria is, under the tested conditions, more robust to increased physical confinement compared to that of low aspect~ratio bacteria. Thus, our experimental evidence supports that environmental physical constraints can play a selective role in bacterial growth based on cell shape.},

During embryogenesis 671 cells are generated; in the hermaphrodite 113 of these (in the male 111) undergo programmed death and the remainder either differentiate terminally or become postembryonic blast cells. The embryonic lineage is highly invariant, as are the fates of the cells to which it gives rise. In spite of the fixed relationship between cell ancestry and cell fate, the correlation between them lacks much obvious pattern. Thus, although most neurons arise from the embryonic ectoderm, some are produced by the mesoderm and a few are sisters to muscles; again, lineal boundaries do not necessarily coincide with functional boundaries. Nevertheless, cell ablation experiments (as well as previous cell isolation experiments) demonstrate substantial cell autonomy in at least some sections of embryogenesis. We conclude that the cell lineage itself, complex as it is, plays an important role in determining cell fate. We discuss the origin of the repeat units (partial segments) in the body wall, the generation of the various orders of symmetry, the analysis of the lineage in terms of sublineages, and evolutionary implications.},

And more generally, how to summarize high-order data cubes (tensors)? How to incrementally update these patterns over time? Matrix decompositions, like principal component analysis (PCA) and variants, are invaluable tools for mining, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, rule identification in numerous settings like streaming data, text, graphs, social networks, and many more settings. However, they have only two orders (i.e., matrices, like author and keyword in the previous example).We propose to envision such higher-order data as tensors, and tap the vast literature on the topic. However, these methods do not necessarily scale up, let alone operate on semi-infinite streams. Thus, we introduce a general framework, incremental tensor analysis (ITA), which efficiently computes a compact summary for high-order and high-dimensional data, and also reveals the hidden correlations. Three variants of ITA are presented: (1) dynamic tensor analysis (DTA); (2) streaming tensor analysis (STA); and (3) window-based tensor analysis (WTA). In paricular, we explore several fundamental design trade-offs such as space efficiency, computational cost, approximation accuracy, time dependency, and model complexity.We implement all our methods and apply them in several real settings, such as network anomaly detection, multiway latent semantic indexing on citation networks, and correlation study on sensor measurements. Our empirical studies show that the proposed methods are fast and accurate and that they find interesting patterns and outliers on the real datasets.},

Here we reduced this complexity by focusing on cellular organization---a key readout and driver of cell behaviour3,4---at the level of major cellular structures that represent distinct organelles and functional machines, and generated the WTC-11 hiPSC Single-Cell Image Dataset v1, which contains more than 200,000 live cells in 3D, spanning 25 key cellular structures. The scale and quality of this dataset permitted the creation of a generalizable analysis framework to convert raw image data of cells and their structures into dimensionally reduced, quantitative measurements that can be interpreted by humans, and to facilitate data exploration. This framework embraces the vast cell-to-cell variability that is observed within a normal population, facilitates the integration of cell-by-cell structural data and allows quantitative analyses of distinct, separable aspects of organization within and across different cell populations. We found that the integrated intracellular organization of interphase cells was robust to the wide range of variation in cell shape in the population; that the average locations of some structures became polarized in cells at the edges of colonies while maintaining the `wiring' of their interactions with other structures; and that, by contrast, changes in the location of structures during early mitotic reorganization were accompanied by changes in their wiring.},

  abstract = {Morphogenesis and cell state transitions must be coordinated in time and space to produce a functional tissue. An excellent paradigm to understand the coupling of these processes is mammalian hair follicle development, which is initiated by the formation of an epithelial invagination---termed placode---that coincides with the emergence of a designated hair follicle stem cell population. The mechanisms directing the deformation of the epithelium, cell state transitions and physical compartmentalization of the placode are unknown. Here we identify a key role for coordinated mechanical forces stemming from contractile, proliferative and proteolytic activities across the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments in generating the placode structure. A ring of fibroblast cells gradually wraps around the placode cells to generate centripetal contractile forces, which, in collaboration with polarized epithelial myosin activity, promote elongation and local tissue thickening. These mechanical stresses further enhance compartmentalization of Sox9 expression to promote stem cell positioning. Subsequently, proteolytic remodelling locally softens the basement membrane to facilitate a release of pressure on the placode, enabling localized cell divisions, tissue fluidification and epithelial invagination into the underlying mesenchyme. Together, our experiments and modelling identify dynamic cell shape transformations and tissue-scale mechanical cooperation as key factors for orchestrating organ formation.},

In this paper, we present zkCor, an efficient and reliable label noise correction scheme with zero-knowledge confidentiality. Our method is designed upon FedCorr [1], but with more relaxed security assumptions. zkCor is established from the ingenious synergy of the label noise correction protocol and the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), requiring each client to provide a computation integrity proof to the aggregator in each iteration. Thus, clients are forced to jointly guarantee label-correction reliability. We further devise a batch ZKP that is efficient and more suitable for federated learning settings. We rigorously illustrate the building blocks of zkCor and complete the prototype implementation. The extensive experiments demonstrate that zkCor can gain at least 2 to 30 times better performance than the baseline approach on verification workloads with nearly no extra proof time cost from clients.},

  abstract = {Biclustering is a powerful data mining technique that allows clustering of rows and columns, simultaneously, in a matrix-format data set. It was first applied to gene expression data in 2000, aiming to identify co-expressed genes under a subset of all the conditions/samples. During the past 17\,years, tens of biclustering algorithms and tools have been developed to enhance the ability to make sense out of large data sets generated in the wake of high-throughput omics technologies. These algorithms and tools have been applied to a wide variety of data types, including but not limited to, genomes, transcriptomes, exomes, epigenomes, phenomes and pharmacogenomes. However, there is still a considerable gap between biclustering methodology development and comprehensive data interpretation, mainly because of the lack of knowledge for the selection of appropriate biclustering tools and further supporting computational techniques in specific studies. Here, we first deliver a brief introduction to the existing biclustering algorithms and tools in public domain, and then systematically summarize the basic applications of biclustering for biological data and more advanced applications of biclustering for biomedical data. This review will assist researchers to effectively analyze their big data and generate valuable biological knowledge and novel insights with higher efficiency.},

  abstract = {Cell migration is essential for physiological processes as diverse as development, immune defence and wound healing. It is also a hallmark of cancer malignancy. Thousands of publications have elucidated detailed molecular and biophysical mechanisms of cultured cells migrating on flat, 2D substrates of glass and plastic. However, much less is known about how cells successfully navigate the complex 3D environments of living tissues. In these more complex, native environments, cells use multiple modes of migration, including mesenchymal, amoeboid, lobopodial and collective, and these are governed by the local extracellular microenvironment, specific modalities of Rho GTPase signalling and non-muscle myosin contractility. Migration through 3D environments is challenging because it requires the cell to squeeze through complex or dense extracellular structures. Doing so requires specific cellular adaptations to mechanical features of the extracellular matrix (ECM) or its remodelling. In addition, besides navigating through diverse ECM environments and overcoming extracellular barriers, cells often interact with neighbouring cells and tissues through physical and signalling interactions. Accordingly, cells need to call on an impressively wide diversity of mechanisms to meet these challenges. This Review examines how cells use both classical and novel mechanisms of locomotion as they traverse challenging 3D matrices and cellular environments. It focuses on principles rather than details of migratory mechanisms and draws comparisons between 1D, 2D and 3D migration.},

Recently, the biclustering task has been formulated as a convex optimization problem. While this convex recasting of the problem has attractive properties, existing algorithms do not scale well. To address this problem and make convex biclustering a practical tool for analyzing larger data, we propose an implementation of fast convex biclustering called COBRAC to reduce the computing time by iteratively compressing problem size along with the solution path. We apply COBRAC to several gene expression datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. Besides the standalone version for COBRAC, we also developed a related online web server for online calculation and visualization of the downloadable interactive results.

  abstract = {Tensor decomposition is widely used for multi-way data analysis and computations in chemical science. CP decomposition is one of the most useful tensor decomposition models for capturing the essential information in massive multi-way chemical data and for efficiently performing computations with such tensors. However, efficiently and accurately computing the tensor decomposition itself is a nontrivial problem that sometimes limits the advantage of tensor decomposition methods. In this work we propose and test three new decomposition algorithms, that are defined from extrapolation ideas applied to the alternating least square (ALS) algorithm for CP tensor decomposition. The performance of the proposed algorithms are validated on both a variety of simulated datasets and real experimental datasets including fluorescence spectroscopy data, hyperspectral data and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The results show that the proposed algorithms significantly accelerate the standard CP-ALS decomposition while maintaining favorable accuracy. One of the proposed methods, denoted direct inversion of the iterative subspace-like extrapolated ALS(CP-AD), is inspired from widely used extrapolation procedures used in the context of solving non-linear equations in quantum chemistry, and shows a particular attractive combination of a much reduced number of iterations needed for convergence, and modest computational cost. For example, CP-AD provided resulting tensors of similar accuracy but significantly lower computational cost than the standard CP-ALS algorithm and the widely used line-search based CP-ALS extrapolation procedure. The proposed methodology may thereby boost the application of tensor decomposition modeling in both experimental and computational chemistry.},

  abstract = {The increasing pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies has enabled collection of huge amount of trajectories for almost any kind of moving objects. Discovering useful patterns from their movement behaviors can convey valuable knowledge to a variety of critical applications. In this light, we propose a novel concept, called gathering, which is a trajectory pattern modeling various group incidents such as celebrations, parades, protests, traffic jams and so on. A key observation is that these incidents typically involve large congregations of individuals, which form durable and stable areas with high density. In this work, we first develop a set of novel techniques to tackle the challenge of efficient discovery of gathering patterns on archived trajectory dataset. Afterwards, since trajectory databases are inherently dynamic in many real-world scenarios such as traffic monitoring, fleet management and battlefield surveillance, we further propose an online discovery solution by applying a series of optimization schemes, which can keep track of gathering patterns while new trajectory data arrive. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed concepts and the efficiency of the approaches are validated by extensive experiments based on a real taxicab trajectory dataset.},

  abstract = {Mediolateral cell intercalation is a morphogenetic strategy used throughout animal development to reshape tissues. Dorsal intercalation in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo involves the mediolateral intercalation of two rows of dorsal epidermal cells to create a single row that straddles the dorsal midline, and thus is a simple model to study cell intercalation. Polarized protrusive activity during dorsal intercalation requires the C. elegans Rac and RhoG orthologs CED-10 and MIG-2, but how these GTPases are regulated during intercalation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we characterized the role of the Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) TIAM-1 in regulating actin-based protrusive dynamics during dorsal intercalation. We found that TIAM-1 can promote formation of the main medial lamellipodial protrusion extended by intercalating cells through its canonical GEF function, whereas its N-terminal domains function to negatively regulate the generation of ectopic filiform protrusions around the periphery of intercalating cells. We also show that the guidance receptor UNC-5 inhibits these ectopic filiform protrusions in dorsal epidermal cells and that this effect is in part mediated via TIAM-1. These results expand the network of proteins that regulate basolateral protrusive activity during directed rearrangement of epithelial cells in animal embryos.},
